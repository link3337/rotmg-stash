## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended)

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/link3337/rotmg-stash.git
cd rotmg-stash
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
mv .env.example .env
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

### Launching Exalt

To use RotMG Stash with the game client, you'll need to generate a device token. This is similar to Unity's [Device Unique Identifier](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/SystemInfo-deviceUniqueIdentifier.html).

1. Get the PowerShell script:

   - Download `generate-device-token.ps1` from the `scripts` folder, or
   - Copy the script content

2. Run the script:

   ```powershell
   .\generate-device-token.ps1
   ```

   or copy paste the content into Powershell

3. Configure RotMG Stash:
   - Copy the generated device token
   - Open Settings > Experimental
   - Paste the token into the Device Token field
   - Set your Exalt path

> **Note**: The device token is uniquely generated from your hardware information (Win32_BaseBoard, Win32_BIOS, and Win32_OperatingSystem SerialNumbers).
